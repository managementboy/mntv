This is a brief explaination of the MythNetTV code:

mythnettv
=========

This source file is the original user interface. Its a simple command line
oriented user interface, which doesn't let you run more than one command at a
time.

mythnettvcore.py
================

The user interface just calls into here. This file calls all the other modules
as required. If you're writing a new user interface for MythNetTV, then you
should just have to import this file and off you go.

database.py
===========

This code handles the MySQL database.

program.py
==========

This code is an abstraction over the database used to handle each program.

syndication.py
======

Everything needed for subscriptions.

video.py
========

Video helper routines.
