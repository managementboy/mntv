The following commands have no unit testing coverage at all. Other commands
are at least partially tested, even if that testing isn't complete yet.


(manual usage)
  file <url> <title>: to do the same, but from a file, with a show
                      title like url above

  cleartodo         : permanently remove all items from the TODO
                      list
  markread <num>    : interactively mark some of the oldest <num>
                      shows as already downloaded and imported
  markread <num> <title filter>
                    : the same as above, but filter to only mark
                      shows with a title exactly matching the
                      specified filter
  markread <num> <title filter> <subtitle filter>
                    : the same as above, but with a regexp title
                      filter as well

(handy stuff)
  todoremote        : add a remote URL to the TODO list. This will
                      prompt for needed information about the
                      video, and set the date of the program to
                      now
  todoremote <url> <title> <subtitle> <description>
                    : the same as above, but don't prompt for
                      anything
  importtorrent <url> <title> <subtitle> <description>
                    : the same as above, but force the URL to be
                      treated as a torrent. This is useful when
                      MythNetTV doesn't automatically detect
                      that the URL is to a torrent file.
  importlocal <file>: import the named file, using the title, 
                      subtitle and description from the command
                      line. The file will be left on disk.
  importlocal <file>: import the named file. The file will be
                      left on disk. Will prompt for needed
                      information
  importmanylocal <path> <regexp> <title>:
                      import all the files from path matching
                      regexp. title is use as the title for the
                      program, and the filename is used as the
                      subtitle

(subscription management)
  list              : list subscriptions
  unsubscribe <url> : unsubscribe from a URL
  archive <title> <path>
                    : archive all programs with this title to the
                      specified path. This is useful for shows you
                      download and import, but want to build a
                      non-MythTV archive of as well
