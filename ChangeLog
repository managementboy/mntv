  Development changes:

Release 4 -> Release 5:
  - There is now a users mailing list at
    http://lists.stillhq.com/listinfo.cgi/mythnettv-stillhq.com
  - Moved to a public SVN server at
    http://www.stillhq.com/mythtv/mythnettv/svn/

  - Added the 'justone' syntax to the download command
  - Another try at using gflags. This means that all the command lines have
    changed slightly.
  - Moved the core of MythTV out of the user interface file.
  - Started writing unit tests
  - Changed user output code so that it doesn't insist on writing to stdout.
    You can now write to other file descriptors, which makes things like unit
    tests much easier to write.
  - Added video/msvideo to the enclosure whitelist
  - Added HTTP download progress information
  - Added a flag which turns off the prompts for markread (--noprompt)
  - Patches from Thomas Mashos
    - Search ~/.mythtv/mysql.txt, /usr/share/mythtv/mysql.txt and
      /etc/mythtv/mysql.txt in that order for MySQL connection information
    - A manpage
    - setup.py
  - video.py now has a simple command line interface to let you query it
	
  - Fix update of inactive programs bug per
    http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5580005&postcount=4
  - Better DB error handling
  - Included a COPYING file with the right version of the GPL (it was missing
    before)
  - Fixed a bug where programs would be downloaded more than once (found with
    a unit test!)
  - Started raising exceptions instead of just sys.exit(1). This should make
    life easier for user interfaces in the future
  - Default to using storage groups for storing recordings before falling back
    to the RecordFilePrefix. This makes the behaviour: use a storage group
    named "MythNetTV" if it exists; use the default storage group if it
    exists; use the value of RecordFilePrefix.
  - Transcode avc1 videos, because some need it
  - Force ASCII encoding of title, subtitle, and all fields in the database
    to get around feeds which use unicode which python / MySQL can't store
    correctly
  - If there is only one attachment to an item, and its not in our whitelist
    of video formats, then warn the user that you're assuming its a video file
    and then add it to the todo list
  - Slight tweak to the signature of video.MythNetTvVideo.Transcode()
  - Fix buf in RepairMissingDates which caused it to consistently crash
  - Fix typo in date warning code
  - Better handling of videos where the length of the video cannot be
    determined by mplayer
	
Release 3 -> Release 4:
  - Removed gflags because people found it hard to find
  - Bug fix patch from David Linville applied
    - Fixed broken imports caused by refactoring
    - Transcode not needed for avc1 and m4v
  - Another bug fix patch from David Linville applied
    - Store filesize in the db
  - Removed some namespace imports I am not a fan of
  - Made verbosity optional for --update
  - Small code cleanups
  - Let the user know of repeated attempts to download a program
  - Documented the need for bittornado for bittorrent to work
  - Abandon downloading after 3 failed attempts (you can configure the number)
  - Detect stuck bittorrent downloads
	
Release 2 -> Release 3:
  - Started work on an RSS exporter for MythTV recordings
  - DX50 doesn't need transcode
  - Tweaked supported video mime types so "Tikibar TV" and "Ask a ninja" work
  - First cut of Bittorrent support
  - Schema upgrades
  - Archive recordings as well as importing them
  - Improved --list output
  - Subtitle restrictions on download as well
  - Make subscriptions inactive instead of deleting them (for unsubscribe)
  - Better filename safening
  - More markread options
  - Refactored code to be more sane
  - Don't archive things imported from the archive location
  - Bulk import (--importmanylocal)
	
THINGS I NEED TO REIMPLEMENT BECAUSE OF MY ACCIDENTAL DELETE:
  - Give up on downloads after 5 failed attempts

Release 1 -> Release 2:
  - Started working harder to ensure video filenames are unique once imported
    into MythTV, I now prepend video files with epoch seconds at time of
    import
  - DIVX (not divx) doesn't need transcode, added. Check for the existance of
    the video directory, and return an error if it needs creating.
  - Handle storage groups, check for the existance of the data directory
  - Updated docs
  - Complained about the poor state of SWF support
  - WMV support
  - FLV support

Beta 4 -> Release 1:
  - Inital work on transcoding smaller files to something else
  - Better error checking for MySQL configuration and accessibility
  - Fixed bug where MythNetTV was unhappy if there were no channels configured
    in the MySQL database
  - Found, and hopefully fixed, a bug where program dates were not always being
    tracked correctly. Also added a check to make sure this doesn't happen
    again
  - Added --markread, which lets you mark old shows as already downloaded

Beta 3 -> Beta 4:
  - Made --update more terse
  - Made --update more liberal about what it considers to be a video,
    specifically added video/quicktime and text/html (to work around the rather
    broken http://www.mobuzztv.com/uk/rss/quicktime
  - Added a filter option to --download to constrain it to only downloading 
    shows with a specific title
  - Added transcoding for mov files
  - If there is a straggling import, and it causes as error, just skip it and
    mark it as imported
  - Don't reset transferred data statistic when we start downloading a show
    again
  - Started implementing moniker support for downloads
  - Unsupported monikers will result in an attempt to download the URL using
    mplayer (which works for RTSP and MMS at the least)

Beta 2 -> Beta 3:
  - Renamed to mythnettv
  - todoremote bug fixed (bad column name)
  - statistics bug fixed (no transfer stats caused crash)
  - It is now possible to do a --todoremote, --importremote, or --importlocal
    and provide all the needed information on the command line

Beta 1 -> Beta 2:
  - Now 50% of downloaded programs will be from the oldest queued, and 50% are
    the newest queued
  - Added --importremote, --todoremote, and --importlocal
  - Implemented transcoding via mencoder. It's quite possible it'll encounter
    a format it doesn't know about. Please let me know if that happens to you.
  - Added --subscribe, --unsubscribe, --list and --update
  - Added --statistics, --log, and --nextdownload
