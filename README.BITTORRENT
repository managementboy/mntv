Bittorrent support in MythNetTv was implemented using bittornado, as it had the
most parsable output of the clients. This version of mythnettv changed that
by moving the download to transmission as client. It can use DHT and
includes other nice modern features.

To install transmission-cli on a Debian system, you do this:

$ sudo apt-get install transmission-cli

Currently the password and login are hard coded  to admin, admin.
